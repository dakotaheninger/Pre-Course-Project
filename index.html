                 <p>Before we talk about me let me introduce you to my website. As you can tell, it's the best there has ever been. As the title at the top so majesticaly suggests, this website is my Golden Ticket to entrance into V School. Upon passing all the tests, with flying colors might I add, I become the CEO of the company right? That's just in chocolate factories? We can discuss the minor details later. Well ladies and gentelmen, without futher ado, I introduce you to my website.</p>
                 <p> As you can see along the top of the page there are three links that will assist you in navigating through this most desirable website. Each link will take you to a different page that will have a description of the amazing things that page can do. Feel free to explore!</p>
